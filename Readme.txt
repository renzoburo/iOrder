Change the connection string in the web.config file to enable connections.

COMMENTS:
This project doesn't use EntityFramework but a lighter version of an ORM I wrote for personal use. The
reason for this is because I wanted to showcase my understanding and skill with database management through C#.
My full ORM is written using text templates (tt files) and is far more robust and intuitive nut you get the same
speed burst from this lighter version.

I have not implemented any logging (for which I would have set up log4net) for exceptions due to time constraints.

I have used knockout.js instead of VUE or Razor as I am use to it and my Razor is a bit rusty and I don't know VUE.
It contains some CSS but not much (just enough to show I know what I am doing).

!!!Thank you for your consideration!!!
